Welcome to the WISE-Translate project!

This is a community project for translating the WISE interface and WISE projects.

How to Translate

Please go to WISE4.org/translate to start translating! Get the username/password to translate from WISE staff (telsportal at gmail dot com).

As you start to translate, theã€€updated translation file text will appear in a textbox when you hit "save". Copy and save the contents for backup.
When you are finished, send the final text to WISE staff and they will add it to the core build.

Let the WISE staff know (telsportal at gmail dot com) when you are done with translation and they will add it to the core build.
