Welcome to the WISE-Translate project!

This is a community project for translating the WISE interface and WISE projects.

Before you begin:
Please use Firefox. Currently this does not work on Chrome and Safari.

Workflow:
1. Translator (T) creates account on GitHub and becomes a member of the WISE-Community (https://github.com/WISE-Community). To become a member, T can email wise4-dev@googlegroups.com with T's GitHub username.
2. T clones WISE-Translation Project (WTP), at https://github.com/WISE-Community/WISE-Translate.  If T has a mac and is not familiar with command-line git, T can get the GitHub Client App for Mac (http://mac.github.com/).
3. T opens up WTP (WISE-Translation/index.html) using the browser and uses the web interface to translate (see additional instructions in WTP).
4. When finished with the translation, T clicks on the "Show Translation File" button, which brings up a dialog with the contents of translated file (see additional instructions in WTP).
5. T copies&pastes the contents of the translated file and pastes&saves it in his checkout copy of the file (see additional instructions in WTP).
6. T commits and pushes the changes back to the WISE-Translation GitHub project (using git command line or a git client application)
